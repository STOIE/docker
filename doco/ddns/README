Resolv.conf points to all 3 DNS servers.
These are picked up from docker -d.
They are all public IP's of the hosts running them.

When a service comes up, it runs a wget to set it's DNS to all 3 servers.

When a DNS server is found unresponsive for N responses:
* Start new container with param for DNS number..
* docker run -d ddns dns02.ris.environment.gov.au
* Should start replacement on "non-broken" container. (not currently already running an instance.)
* if all are either running or dead... then major alert is raised.

Lighttpd port running auth needs to exist on rando port. (not 80)
